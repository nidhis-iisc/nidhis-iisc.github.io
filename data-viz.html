            <p><strong>Analysis Summary: Number of Schools across Districts," shows a significant variation in the number of schools among the districts.
                The East district has the highest count, approximately 120 schools, followed by North West A and South East
            which also show high numbers. In stark contrast, the New Delhi district has the fewest schools, with a count 
            of only about three or four. Overall, the data illustrates a sharp drop-off in the total number of schools 
            from the highest-ranking districts to the lowest.</strong></p>

            <h2>3. Bar Plot: Total Number of Schools per District</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Analysis Summary:</strong> The comparison plot highlights significant infrastructure disparities. Specifically, the **North West A** district registers the highest number of schools (117), while the **Central** district shows the lowest infrastructure with only 22 schools. This disparity emphasizes the need for resource allocation models that are proportional to regional demands, rather than a uniform distribution across all areas.</p>
