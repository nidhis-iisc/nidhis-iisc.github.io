            <img src="plots/Schools_districts.png" alt="Plot showing distribution of number of schools per districts" style="max-width: 700px;">
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>There is significant variation in the number of schools among the districts. The East district has the highest count, approximately 120 schools, followed by North West A and South East which also show high numbers. In stark contrast, the New Delhi district has the fewest schools, with a count of only about three or four. Overall, the data illustrates a sharp drop-off in the total number of schools from the highest-ranking districts to the lowest.</p>

            <img src="plots/school_type_districts.png" alt="Plot showing distribution of school types across districts" style="max-width: 700px;">

            <p>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong>There is significant dominance of Senior Secondary Schools across all districts.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Senior Secondary Schools:</strong> These schools are the most numerous. The districts with the highest counts are <strong>East</strong> and <strong>North West A</strong>, both having approximately 110 Senior Secondary Schools. <strong>South East</strong> also shows a high count, around 90.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Other School Types:</strong> Counts for <strong>Primary</strong>, <strong>Middle</strong>, and <strong>Secondary</strong> schools are <strong>substantially lower</strong> compared to the Senior Secondary level across all districts, often registering near-zero.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exceptions:</strong> The <strong>South East</strong> and <strong>North East-II</strong> districts show a slightly higher, though still small, count of <strong>Secondary</strong> schools (green bars), reaching around 14-15. The <strong>East</strong> district shows the highest count of <strong>Primary</strong> schools (blue bar), at around 7-8.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lowest Count:</strong> The <strong>New Delhi</strong> district has the lowest numbers overall, with its Senior Secondary school count being very low (around 3-4), and other school types being negligible.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
            In conclusion, the data indicates that the educational infrastructure in these districts is heavily weighted toward the <strong>Senior Secondary level</strong>.
