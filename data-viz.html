            <h2>1. Total Number of Schools per districts</h2>
            <img src="plots/Schools_districts.png" alt="Plot showing distribution of number of schools per districts" style="max-width: 700px;">
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>There is significant variation in the number of schools among the districts. The East district has the highest count, approximately 120 schools, followed by North West A and South East which also show high numbers. In stark contrast, the New Delhi district has the fewest schools, with a count of only about three or four. Overall, the data illustrates a sharp drop-off in the total number of schools from the highest-ranking districts to the lowest.</p>

            <h2>2. Distibution of School Types across districts</h2>
            <img src="plots/school_type_districts.png" alt="Plot showing distribution of school types across districts" style="max-width: 700px;">

            <p>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong>There is significant dominance of Senior Secondary Schools across all districts.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Senior Secondary Schools:</strong> These schools are the most numerous. The districts with the highest counts are <strong>East</strong> and <strong>North West A</strong>, both having approximately 110 Senior Secondary Schools. <strong>South East</strong> also shows a high count, around 90.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Other School Types:</strong> Counts for <strong>Primary</strong>, <strong>Middle</strong>, and <strong>Secondary</strong> schools are <strong>substantially lower</strong> compared to the Senior Secondary level across all districts, often registering near-zero.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exceptions:</strong> The <strong>South East</strong> and <strong>North East-II</strong> districts show a slightly higher, though still small, count of <strong>Secondary</strong> schools (green bars), reaching around 14-15. The <strong>East</strong> district shows the highest count of <strong>Primary</strong> schools (blue bar), at around 7-8.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lowest Count:</strong> The <strong>New Delhi</strong> district has the lowest numbers overall, with its Senior Secondary school count being very low (around 3-4), and other school types being negligible.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
            In conclusion, the data indicates that the educational infrastructure in these districts is heavily weighted toward the <strong>Senior Secondary level</strong>.

                <li>
                    <strong>Female Dominance:</strong> Several districts show a noticeable majority of female students, including <strong>East</strong>, <strong>North East-I</strong>, <strong>North West A</strong>, <strong>West B</strong>, and <strong>South East</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Balanced Enrollment:</strong> The <strong>North West B-I</strong> district stands out with the most balanced gender enrollment, with both boys and girls registering around 70,000 students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lowest Enrollment:</strong> Consistent with prior data, the <strong>New Delhi</strong> district shows negligible enrollment for both genders, near the zero mark.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            In summary, the data indicates a slightly higher participation rate for girls compared to boys across the majority of the districts.

            <h2>5. Analysis of Spread of Pass Percentages across Districts (Class X vs. Class XII)</h2>
            <img src="plots/pass_pct_boxplot.png" style="max-width: 700px;">
            <p>
            The box plot illustrates the distribution and variability of pass percentages for Class X and Class XII across the districts.
            </p>
            
            <p> <strong>Analysis: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Median Pass Percentage:</strong> The median (the orange line inside the box) for <strong>Class XII is significantly higher</strong> than that of Class X. Class XII's median is approximately 97.2%, while Class X's median is around 94.5%. This suggests that, on average, districts perform better at the Class XII level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Variability (Spread):</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Class X</strong> shows a wider overall spread, ranging from a minimum of approximately 90% up to a maximum near 98.5%. This indicates greater variability or inconsistency in Class X pass percentages across different districts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Class XII</strong> shows a narrower overall spread, ranging from a minimum of approximately 94% up to a maximum near 99.5%. This indicates <strong>less variability</strong> and generally higher minimum performance across districts for Class XII.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interquartile Range (IQR):</strong> The box itself, representing the middle 50% of the data (IQR), is generally positioned higher for Class XII (between ~96% and ~98.5%) compared to Class X (between ~93% and ~97.5%).
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            In summary, districts tend to achieve a <strong>higher median pass rate with less variation</strong> in performance at the Class XII level compared to the Class X level.

            <p> <strong>Analysis: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Girls constitute a slight majority</strong> of the total student enrollment, accounting for <strong>52.02%</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Boys represent 47.98%</strong> of the total student enrollment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            This distribution indicates that, in total, there are slightly more female students than male students enrolled across the analyzed districts (a difference of approximately 4%).

            <p>
            These two clustered bar charts compare the number of students who appeared for and passed the Class X and Class XII examinations across various districts.
            </p>
            <h3>Overall Trends (Applicable to both Classes):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>High Pass Rate:</strong> In both Class X and Class XII, the number of students who passed (orange bar) is only marginally lower than the number of students who appeared (blue bar) in almost all districts. This indicates a consistently <strong>very high pass percentage</strong> at both levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>High Volume Districts:</strong> The districts with the highest student volumes for both appearing and passing are <strong>East</strong>, <strong>North West A</strong>, and <strong>South East</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Low Volume Districts:</strong> The <strong>New Delhi</strong> district shows virtually no activity, and the <strong>Central</strong> district registers the lowest meaningful student numbers for both classes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Comparative Analysis (Class X vs. Class XII):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Student Drop-off:</strong> High-volume districts like **East** and **South East** show a noticeably higher number of students appearing for **Class X** (East: ~20,000; South East: ~19,000) compared to **Class XII** (East: ~17,500; South East: ~17,800). This suggests a moderate drop-off in enrollment between the secondary and senior secondary levels in these districts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consistency of Pass Rate:</strong> While the pass rate is high for both, a close inspection suggests that the gap between appeared and passed students (i.e., the failure count) is very slightly smaller for most Class XII clusters than for the corresponding Class X clusters. This aligns with the box plot analysis showing a slightly higher pass percentage for Class XII.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>West B District:</strong> This district is one of the few where the number of students appearing for **Class XII** (~15,000) is roughly the same as those appearing for **Class X** (~15,000).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            In conclusion, the data demonstrates high student retention from appearance to passing in both classes, but with consistently higher overall student volumes observed at the Class X level compared to Class XII.
