            <h2>2. Box Plot: Class XII Pass Percentage Distribution</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Analysis Summary:</strong> The distribution of the Class XII academic performance metric is notably tight, with most regional areas clustering together. This narrow range suggests highly similar outcomes across the region, pointing to uniform educational quality or highly consistent grading criteria across all districts.</p>

            <h2>3. Bar Plot: Total Number of Schools per District</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Analysis Summary:</strong> The comparison plot highlights significant infrastructure disparities. Specifically, the **North West A** district registers the highest number of schools (117), while the **Central** district shows the lowest infrastructure with only 22 schools. This disparity emphasizes the need for resource allocation models that are proportional to regional demands, rather than a uniform distribution across all areas.</p>
